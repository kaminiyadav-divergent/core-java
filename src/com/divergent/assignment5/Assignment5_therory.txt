1.When should the private methods be used in a class?
Ans: Private methods are used for breaking the task into smaller task.it is also called helper methods.

2. Do we need encapsulation for constants?
Ans: no there is no need of encapsulation for constant.

3.What are two benefits of using the Factory methods?
Ans: factory methods allows the subclass to choose the type of object.
	A factory method can have better name from that describes what they do.
4. Overloading is runtime or compiletime?
Ans: Overloading is compile time.

5. What are the three ways of initializing instance variables?
Ans: You can initialize variables of a class using
     1. Final method
     2. constructors
     3. Instance initialization blocks

6. What is constructor chaining?
Ans : It is a process of calling one constructor from another constructor w.r.t current object within the same class.

7. Use a static block initialization block to show it use.
Ans: static initialization Block can only initialize the static instance variables. Thest block are only executed once when the class is loaded.

8.  Use a non static block initialization block to show it use.
Ans: Instance variables are initialized using non static initialization block. These block are executed when the 
object is created and before the invocation of the constructor.

9. what is static Import?
Ans: with the help of static import we can access the static members of the class directly without the class name or ant object. for example 

10. Why "finalize" method is deprecated?
Ans: finalize method is deprecated because of it's behaviour.

11. proper way of naming a package:
Ans : {domain name in reverse order} . {moodulename}. {Application name}
example: com.divergent.clinicdatabademanagement

12. What are various class Design guidelines?
Ans : Always keep data private.
      Always initialize variables.
      Name of the class can be Noun or it should reflect their purpose.
      Method should not contain more than 30-35 lines of code.
